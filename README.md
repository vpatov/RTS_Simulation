# RTS_Simulation
A simulation of an RTS game made for a graduate mathematics course at Stony Brook University.

A two-player game played by two AIs. Each AI is a tuple of integers that represents a policy. At certain random interarrival times, both players receive some random amount of gold (same for ecah). At every timestep, the policy dictates wether an AI will make units of type 1,2, or 3, and wether the AI will send out all the units in its base to attack.
